    What Was Iago’s Motivations?
  </head1>
  <br>
  <body>
Originally Iago was jealous and angry that Othello did not give him the position of Lieutenant. Iago wanted his revenge. Iago later thinks that his wife, Emilia cheated on him with Othello, even though Othello and Emilia showed no interest in each other. His plan was to kill Othello by manipulating others to do it. He convinced Othello that Desdemona was cheating on him with Cassio. Later Othello kills his wife after she wakes up. After realising that his wife was innocent, Othello committed suicide.

Why Did I Choose This Picture?
  </head>
  <br>
<body>
  In this picture you can see Desdemona lying on the bed after Othello has killed her, and you can see Othello lying on the floor. You can also see the soldiers taking Iago away.

Is Iago A Villan or Victim?
    </head>
  <br>
  <body>
In my opinion Iago is a villain. Even though he personally committed one crime, which was killing Rodrigo, he manipulated other people into killing the people he wanted. Iago’s plan was to kill Othello. He did not kill Othello himself, first he made Othello believe that his wife was cheating on him and then when Othello found out that he was wrong he killed himself. Everyone who dies in this play was part of Iago’s plan, so it is Iago’s fault that they are dead.
